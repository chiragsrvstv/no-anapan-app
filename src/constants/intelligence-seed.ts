          preview: `18 job posts | 9 senior folks required | Strong industry tailwind`,
          body: `### **Trend Spotted at Google**

Google is expanding its in-house silicon development with the Tensor series, aiming for greater AI processing efficiency and differentiation from Apple and Qualcomm. The company is investing heavily in on-device AI, integrating features like Magic Editor, Best Take, and AI Overviews into Pixel devices.

From a hardware perspective, this shift introduces complex validation and testing requirements:

- Tensor G3 was designed in collaboration with Samsung’s 4nm process, and the upcoming G4 and G5 chips are expected to use TSMC’s advanced nodes for higher efficiency.
- AI-powered Pixel features require low-latency AI inference, which increases the need for chip-level optimisations, thermal management, and RF efficiency improvements.
- Google’s Pixel sales reached 10 million units in 2023, with expectations of further growth as AI adoption increases. However, hardware testing and RF validation remain bottlenecks in accelerating Pixel’s go-to-market timeline.

### **Problem Statements Developing from This Trend**

1. **Validation Bottlenecks in Tensor AI Chip Development**
    - AI-centric chip design demands rigorous ASIC validation to optimize AI performance per watt while ensuring power efficiency and heat dissipation.
    - Tensor chip’s AI workloads (e.g., Gemini AI) require real-time inference optimizations, which means Google must ensure chip reliability across multiple AI use cases.
2. **RF & Hardware Testing Constraints for Pixel Devices**
    - The antenna design and RF tuning for Pixel’s 5G and Wi-Fi performance require extensive hardware validation to match the standards set by Apple’s iPhones and Samsung’s Galaxy series.
    - Google lacks in-house testing infrastructure for large-scale RF validation and environmental stress testing, which could slow down new product rollouts.

### **Hiring Data Indicating a Resource Crunch**

- 18 active job listings (12% of all hardware roles) are specifically related to silicon performance, ASIC validation, and embedded systems, indicating a hiring gap in chip development.
- 9 of these roles are mid-to-senior positions (Lead CPU Architect, System Engineer, Power and Performance), suggesting difficulty in hiring experienced silicon engineers.
- Hiring locations: US, India, Canada, Germany, with particular hiring activity in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which aligns well with Sasken’s engineering presence.

### **Proposed Solution**

Sasken can offer AI-driven hardware validation, RF testing, and ASIC verification services to accelerate Tensor chip and Pixel device optimization.
